Our aim is to provide more specific feedback for automatically graded essays. To achieve this, we use an essay dataset - "The Hewlett Foundation: Automated Essay Scoring"1 dataset. We used a subset of this dataset, set eight, which is labeled with scores across six different rubric categories: ideas/content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, and conventions.
