 - All of our code is contained within a single Jupyter Notebook file, main.ipynb
 - To run the code you can run the code cells in main.ipynb
 - You will also need to download the dataset in order to run the code which is available here:  http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/
 - Because the code takes a long time to run, we have left the output of our code in the Jupyter Notebook file
